  - [x] Create basic HTML/CSS/JS file structure (`src/classic-2d/`)
  - [x] Implement Canvas setup and basic rendering loop (`requestAnimationFrame`)
  - [x] Implement Grid representation (2D array: Uncaptured, Captured, Trail)
  - [x] Implement Player rendering and 4-directional keyboard movement
  - [x] Implement Trail drawing logic (update grid state)
  - [x] Implement Area Capture logic (detect return to safe zone, basic flood fill)
  - [x] Implement basic Enemy rendering and movement (Bouncer, Patroller)
  - [x] Implement basic Collision Detection (Player-Enemy, Player-Trail)
  - [x] Implement Lives and Score display
  - [x] **Playground/Testing**: Verify core 2D Xonix gameplay loop.

    - [ ] Add ambient effects (particles, background elements)
  - [ ] **Build System Updates**
    - [ ] Update package.json scripts to support both versions:
      - [ ] Add `dev:classic` and `dev:3d` script commands
      - [ ] Create `build:classic` and `build:3d` build scripts
      - [ ] Add combined build command for production
    - [ ] Implement shared asset loading system
  - [ ] **Playground/Testing**
    - [ ] Create test levels to showcase 3D visualization
    - [ ] Perform cross-browser compatibility testing
    - [ ] Optimize for different device capabilities
- [ ] **Step 3: 3D Transition (Level 3)**
  - [ ] Add special transition triggers (glowing orbs) to level
  - [ ] Create `AnimationSystem.ts` for 2Dâ†’3D grid rotation animation
  - [ ] Update physics system for 3D space
  - [ ] Implement camera follow behavior in `useFollowCamera.ts`
  - [ ] Update grid system for 2.5D/3D representation
  - [ ] Add `is3DMode` state to `gameStore.ts`
  - [ ] **Playground/Testing**: Test transition from 2D to 3D via orb collection
- [ ] **Step 4: 3D Gameplay (Level 4)**
  - [ ] Extend `GridMath.ts` for multi-plane filling (XY, XZ, YZ planes)
  - [ ] Implement 3D volume detection (cubes, prisms)
  - [ ] Add scoring bonuses for 3D shape completion
  - [ ] Update enemy movement patterns for 3D navigation
  - [ ] Improve 3D shape visualization
